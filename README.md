This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

To run the program:
1: Open  the application in an editor (eg. vscode) and open the terminal.
2: Ensure you are in the right folder and then run "npm run dev".
3: If it doesn't work and you get error, try run "npm install" and then run "npm run dev". 
4: Open "http://localhost:3000/" on a browser.
5: You should be able to see the application running. 


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
